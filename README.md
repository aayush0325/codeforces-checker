#Codeforces Checker
If you have a doubt whether a Codeforces Account is Cheating or not, you can use this site to find that out. This site checks if the user has cheated based on whether they have a skipped submission in a contest or not. A submission gets skipped when the code has been copy-pasted from someone else. Please don't cheat in contests!!!!!
